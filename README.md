# What Damon Browser
Web browser developed using the EPL from DYWT (the reason for choosing C++ is that there is no EPL option and the EPL itself is based on C++)
## Advantages.
Lightweight, Flash-enabled, easy-to-use
## Disadvantages.
Does not support English, does not support HTML5 player, cannot download files, does not support multi-tab pages, older kernel (Chrome 65 kernel), default UA logo is Windows 10
## Screenshot
Uh...No screenshots because I'm too lazy to take them.
## Remarksï¼š
If you want to experience other web browsers developed using EPL, you can use Aurora Studio's WebWorld browser, but it will show an exception at high DPI, please adjust the compatibility, the official website of the software: https://aurorast.top/webworld (Chinese page, no English, please use the translation tool to visit)
Just to be clear, the source code needs to be opened with EPL 5.9 (China version) or higher or there will be an exception
