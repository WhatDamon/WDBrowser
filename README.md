## Developing:

2.User Agent Edit
## Remarks:
If you want to experience other web browsers developed using EPL, you can use Aurora Studio's WebWorld browser, but it will show an exception at high DPI(After analysis, this browser also has this problem), please adjust the compatibility, the official website of the software: https://aurorast.top/webworld (Chinese page, no English, please use the translation tool to visit)
Of course, you can also use Flysoft's [XNorth browser](https://flysoft.js.org/XNorth.html), which supports dual languages
For some reasons, the software will be seriously delayed, and the source code of the warehouse may have to wait to move
Just to be clear, the source code needs to be opened with EPL 5.9 (China version:易语言) or higher or there will be an exception
